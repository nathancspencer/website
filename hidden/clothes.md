title: Clothes

I appreciate really well made things. I'd rather own 1 quality garmet and wear it to destruction than have thousands of low quality pieces.

The Japanese make probably the highest quality clothing in the world. They have an absolute obsession with replicating American vintage clothing. This is down to the machines they use! 

I find that their products have been designed to last, and so much thought has gone into them that I want to spend the effort repairing them.

There are a few Sydney stores that specialise in this:
- Corlection
- Blueworks

I aspire to make my own clothes. So far I've learnt how to make a belt.
