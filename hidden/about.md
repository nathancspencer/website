Hi, I'm Nathan!

My passion is for making great things. I aspire to be as humble and grateful as I can for this inheritance we have been given.

For work, I make software - currently at Humanitix. I do leatherworking, photography and writing in my free time.

You can contact me at nathancspencer at protonmail dot com.
