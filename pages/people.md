title: People Who Inspire Me

_Jan 2024_

**Tyler Cowen**

- His [podcast](https://conversationswithtyler.com/) is simply amazing. Always asks the most thoughtful questions and brings interesting people on. I listen to every episode.

**Simon Sarris**

- One of the greatest writers online.
- I love his [blog](https://substack.com/@simonsarris) and [book recommendations](https://simonsarris.com/bookshelf).

**Peter Thiel**

- Doesn't really have his own online presence, but the book Zero to One and his podcasts appearances are worth listening to.

**Patrick McKenzie**

- Probably the clearest systems thinker on the internet.
- I like his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patio11) and his old blog, but everything he writes is amazing.

Most of all, I'm inspired by my friends, mentors, and parents, who I owe everything in this world.
