    title: People Who Inspire Me
---

Jan 2024

I've only included people I think are underrated.

Tyler Cowen
- His [podcast](https://conversationswithtyler.com/) is simply amazing. Always asks the most thoughtful questions and brings interesting people one. I listen to every episode.

Simon Sarris
- One of the greatest writers online. 
- I love his [blog](https://substack.com/@simonsarris) and [book recommendations](https://simonsarris.com/bookshelf). 

Peter Thiel
- Doesn't really have his own online presence, but the book Zero to One and his podcasts appearances are worth listening to.

Patrick McKenzie
- Probably the clearest systems thinker on the internet. 
- I like his Twitter and his old blog, but everything he writes is amazing.
